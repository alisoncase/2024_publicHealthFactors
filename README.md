### Final Proposal
1. Persona/Scenario
    Persona: Public health officials and health policy analysts are the target users of this interactive map. In order to aid their decision-making around public health programs or policies to adopt or fund, they may leverage data on health outcomes and health behaviors, such as the data found in the CDC Places Survey. Uncovering broad geographic trends efficiently would help them identify areas for further research or prioritize programs to be funded. In addition, the public is secondary audience for the interactive map, so they may explore the data to participate in policymaking through citizen advocacy and engage in oversight activities. Because the map will be leveraging already publicly-available data, practitioners and the public will be able to use the map to explore the relationships between the different variables in the dataset.

    Scenario: Users can interact with the D3-based map to identify relationships between various health factors, including select health outcomes (e.g., diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol) and health risk behaviors (e.g., physical inactivity), across U.S. counties. The interactive map displays two sets of variables: health outcomes and health risk behaviors. Users can select one variable from each of these two sets, prompting the map to display a bivariate choropleth map showing the relationship between the two selected variables. For example, users can select and view the health outcome “diabetes,” and then select “physical inactivity” from the list of health risk behaviors to display the bivariate map depicting the relationship between diabetes and physical inactivity in each county. 

    Case studies are also highlighted for deeper analysis through supplemental data visualization and narrative to inspire users to engage with the data. Namely, two D3-based maps present examples of bivariate choropleth maps of different states. These visualizations highlight the usefulness of visualizing the relationships between the different variables.
